This is ns-3-allinone.

If you have downloaded this in tarball release format, this directory
contains some released ns-3 version, along with 3rd party components
necessary to support all optional ns-3 features, such as Python
bindings and Network Simulation Cradle.  In this case, just run the
script build.py; all the components, plus ns-3 itself, will thus be
built.

If, on the other hand, you have obtained this by cloning the mercurial
repository, this directory only contains a few python scripts:

  download.py:
   
     This script will take care of downloading all necessary
     components, including pybindgen, NSC, regression testing traces,
     along with cloning a ns-3 repository.  By default, the main
     development ns-3 branch, ns-3-dev, will be cloned, but it can be
     overridden via the -n command line option.

  build.py:

     This script will be all external components that need to be
     built, and then will build ns-3 using the downloaded components.
